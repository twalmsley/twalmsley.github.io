# A Response to a LinkedIn Post

When we spoke the other day, I hadn't yet read the 3D vs 4D ontology study, so my comments about system 1 and system 2 were based on reading "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman. The 3D vs 4D study concluded that humans understand 3D models better than they understand 4D models, despite those people claiming that they understood 4D models very well. The 3D models still model changes over time (3D+time), but not in the same way as 4D models, and it appears that there is nothing that 4D can represent that 3D+time models cannot - I may be wrong on this, so I would be keen to see an example of a 4D model that cannot be represented using 3D+time. The paper is not directly related to the use of ontologies in AI applications.

The "system 1" thinking model of human brains appears to fit fairly well with how LLMs generate their answers - the input essentially "triggers" the output, which is good enough most of the time, but which can also produce convincing-but-incorrect responses. So what is needed is the equivalent of the human "system 2" thinking, which can interpret the results of system 1 and apply some level of logical processing and fact checking, so that the incorrect responses from system 1 can be rejected in favour of better thought out answers.

RAG does not introduce system 2 thinking, it merely provides more context for system 1 thinking that should improve the overall results. MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are similar to RAG in that they provide more context for the LLM, but they also have the opportunity, when invoked by the LLM, to do additional processing and to take real-world action. It _may_ be possible to add some logical processing to the initial results from a prompt, but this will be extremely difficult to implement as system 2 type processing, and the results are passed back to the LLM for explanation which can still be error prone. Given this, in my opinion RAG and MCP cannot behave as system 2 type thinking.

Something else is needed that goes beyond LLMs, and I believe there must be research going on in this area. It may well be that a knowledge graph based on a well-founded ontology (whether 3D or 4D, I don't believe it matters which) is essential to support system 2 type reasoning. I also believe that the knowledge graph is the "easy" part, because it's "just" processing huge amounts of data, which the large AI companies are good at. Traversing the graph based on system 1 responses, and verifying, disproving, or augmenting the results based actual knowledge, will be essential to simulate system 2 thinking - and this feels like the hard part to me. Then the LLM would be relegated to a supporting role, interpreting and generating natural language prompts and responses, as required by the system 2 "mind". We would then be interacting with a "thinking machine" rather than an LLM chatbot. I have some basic ideas about how this might look as a system, but there is no guarantee that it will work, or that it will produce usable results, without significant investment in research and development.

As a last comment, I think that AGI, or super-intelligence, will only be possible by simulating the system 1 and 2 modes of thought. System 1 and 2 are not real, by the way, they are just useful models for interpreting how humans think. As an aside, AGI and super-intelligence do not necessarily bring consciousness, because it might be the case that conscious entities have to be biological, and might also depend on quantum effects, we just don't know yet. Machines could _appear_ conscious without actually _being_ conscious.

The rest of this post is from an LLM - I didn't ask for it, but it looks mostly reasonable so I'm leaving it in.

# AI and System 1/System 2 Thinking

## Introduction

This blog post explores the fascinating intersection between artificial intelligence and the dual-process theory of human cognition, specifically focusing on System 1 and System 2 thinking as described by Daniel Kahneman in "Thinking, Fast and Slow."

## Understanding System 1 and System 2

### System 1: Fast, Automatic, and Intuitive
- Operates automatically and quickly
- Requires little or no effort
- Handles pattern recognition and immediate responses
- Often operates below the level of conscious awareness

### System 2: Slow, Deliberative, and Analytical
- Requires attention and effort
- Handles complex computations and logical reasoning
- Can override System 1 when necessary
- Limited by cognitive load and fatigue

## AI and Dual-Process Architecture

### Current AI Systems
Most current AI systems, particularly large language models, operate more like System 1:
- Fast pattern matching and response generation
- Limited ability to engage in deep, step-by-step reasoning
- Susceptible to biases and heuristics

### The Challenge of System 2 AI
Creating AI systems that can truly engage in System 2 thinking presents several challenges:
- Maintaining attention over extended reasoning chains
- Managing cognitive load and working memory
- Balancing speed with accuracy
- Implementing metacognitive awareness

## Practical Implications

### For AI Development
- Understanding how to design systems that can switch between fast and slow thinking modes
- Developing architectures that can engage in deliberate reasoning when needed
- Creating AI systems that can recognize when they need to "slow down" and think more carefully

### For Human-AI Interaction
- Designing interfaces that support both intuitive and analytical interactions
- Understanding when to trust fast AI responses vs. when to request deeper analysis
- Developing collaborative systems that leverage both human and AI cognitive strengths

## Future Directions

### Hybrid Architectures
The future may lie in AI systems that can dynamically switch between System 1 and System 2 modes:
- Fast, intuitive responses for routine tasks
- Deliberate, step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
- Metacognitive awareness to choose the appropriate mode

### Human-AI Collaboration
The most effective systems may be those that combine:
- Human System 2 capabilities for oversight and judgment
- AI System 1 capabilities for pattern recognition and automation
- Collaborative reasoning for complex problem-solving

## Conclusion

Understanding the parallels between human dual-process thinking and AI system design offers valuable insights for creating more effective and trustworthy AI systems. The challenge lies in developing architectures that can truly engage in both fast, intuitive processing and slow, deliberate reasoning.
