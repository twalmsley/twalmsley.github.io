# Flashlight Functional Requirements

> NOTE: These were mostly generated by a GPT, but with some modifications by me.

Functional requirements define what the flashlight _must do_. 

- **FR-001: Illumination Output.** The flashlight shall produce a white light beam.
- **FR-002: Brightness Control.** The system shall provide at least two user-selectable brightness levels: high and low.
- **FR-003: On/Off Control.** The system shall allow the user to turn the light on and off via a single switch mechanism.
- **FR-004: Power Management.** The system shall draw power from a user-replaceable battery source. 

Performance Requirements

Performance requirements specify _how well_ the functional requirements are to be executed. 

- **PR-001: Lumen Output (High).** The high brightness mode shall produce a minimum of 500 lumens of light output.
- **PR-002: Lumen Output (Low).** The low brightness mode shall produce a minimum of 50 lumens of light output.
- **PR-003: Beam Distance.** The beam shall be visible for an effective distance of at least 100 meters on high setting.
- **PR-004: Run Time (High).** The flashlight shall operate continuously for a minimum of 2 hours on the high setting with a fresh set of standard batteries.
- **PR-005: Run Time (Low).** The flashlight shall operate continuously for a minimum of 10 hours on the low setting with a fresh set of standard batteries. 

Physical Requirements

Physical requirements define the physical attributes and constraints of the device. 

- **PhR-001: Power Source.** The system shall utilize a replaceable set of batteries.
- **PhR-002: Material.** The housing shall be constructed from durable anodized aluminum.
- **PhR-003: Weight.** The total weight, including batteries, shall not exceed 200 grams.
- **PhR-004: Dimensions.** The length shall not exceed 15 cm, and the width and height shall not exceed 3 cm.
- **PhR-005: Ingress Protection.** The flashlight shall have a minimum IPX4 rating for water resistance, meaning it is splash-resistant from any direction. 

System Interfaces

Interface requirements define how the system interacts with external elements. 

- **IR-001: User Interface.** The switch mechanism shall be a push-button located on the tail cap.
- **IR-002: Battery Interface.** The battery compartment shall be accessible via a removable tail cap for easy battery replacement. 

Environmental and Safety Requirements

These requirements ensure the product is safe and reliable in its intended environment.

- **ER-001: Operating Temperature.** The flashlight shall operate within a temperature range of -10°C to 40°C.
- **ER-002: Drop Resistance.** The device shall remain functional after being dropped from a height of 1 meter onto a concrete surface.
- **SR-001: Non-Incendive.** The flashlight shall not be a source of ignition under normal operating conditions.

Also:

1. Beam width constraints
2. Price point constraints
3. Sales targets
4. Profit requirements
